It contains utility functions to assist with inquirer prompting and scaffolding.\n\n# API\n\n## parseValue  \n\nParam: `String`\n\nUsed when you cannot use regular conventions. Handy for examples like `RegExp` or `output.sourcePrefix`\n\n```js\nconst parseValue = require('webpack-addons').parseValue;\n\nthis.configuration.myScaffold.webpackOptions.output.sourcePrefix = parseValue('\\t')\n// sourcePrefix: '\\t'\n```\n## createArrowFunction\n\nParam: `String`\n\nGenerally used when dealing with an entry point as an arrow function.\n\n```js\nconst createArrowFunction = require('webpack-addons').createArrowFunction;\n\nthis.configuration.myScaffold.webpackOptions.entry = createArrowFunction('app.js')\n// entry: () => 'app.js'\n```\n\n## createRegularFunction\n\nParam: `String`\n\nUsed when creating a function that returns a single value.\n```js\nconst createRegularFunction = require('webpack-addons').createRegularFunction;\n\nthis.configuration.myScaffold.webpackOptions.entry = createRegularFunction('app.js')\n// entry: function() { return 'app.js' }\n```\n## createDynamicPromise\n\nParam: `Array` | `String`\n\nUsed to create an dynamic entry point.\n\n```js\nconst createDynamicPromise = require('webpack-addons').createDynamicPromise;\n\nthis.confguration.myScaffold.webpackOptions.entry = createDynamicPromise('app.js')\n// entry: () => new Promise((resolve) => resolve('app.js'))\n\nthis.configuration.myScaffold.webpackOptions.entry = createDynamicPromise(['app.js', 'index.js'])\n// entry: () => new Promise((resolve) => resolve(['app.js','index.js']))\n```\n\n## createAssetFilterFunction\n\nParam: `String`\n\nUsed to create an [assetFilterFunction](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/performance/#performance-assetfilter)\n\n```js\nconst createAssetFilterFunction = require('webpack-addons').createAssetFilterFunction;\n\nthis.configuration.myScaffold.webpackOptions.performance.assetFilter = createAssetFilterFunction('js')\n// assetFilter: function (assetFilename) { return assetFilename.endsWith('.js'); }\n```\n\n## createExternalFunction\n\nParam: `String`\n\nUsed to create an [general function from Externals](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/#function)\n\n```js\nconst createExternalFunction = require('webpack-addons').createExternalFunction;\n\nthis.configuration.myScaffold.webpackOptions.externals = [createExternalFunction('^yourregex$')]\n/*\nexternals: [\n  function(context, request, callback) {\n    if (/^yourregex$/.test(request)){\n      return callback(null, 'commonjs ' + request);\n    }\n    callback();\n  }\n\n*/\n```\n## createCommonsChunkPlugin\n\nParam: `String`\n\nUsed to create a general [`CommonsChunkPlugin`](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/commons-chunk-plugin/).\n\n```js\nconst createCommonsChunkPlugin = require('webpack-addons').createCommonsChunkPlugin;\n\nthis.configuration.myScaffold.webpackOptions.plugins = [createCommonsChunkPlugin('vendor')]\n/*\nplugins: [\n new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({\n    name: 'vendor',\n    filename: 'vendor-[hash].min.js',\n  })\n*/\n```\n\n## createRequire\n\nParam: `String`\n\nUsed to create a module in `topScope`\n\n```js\nconst createRequire = require('webpack-addons').createRequire;\n\nthis.configuration.myScaffold.topScope = [createRequire('webpack')]\n// const webpack = require('webpack')\n```\n\n## [Inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/#prompt-types)\n\n### List\n\nParam: `name<String>, message<String>, choices<Array>`\n\nCreates a List from Inquirer\n```js\nList('entry', 'what kind of entry do you want?', ['Array', 'Function'])\n```\n\n### RawList \n\nParam: `name<String>, message<String>, choices<Array>`\n\nCreates a RawList from Inquirer\n```js\nRawList('entry', 'what kind of entry do you want?', ['Array', 'Function'])\n```\n\n### CheckList\n\nParam: `name<String>, message<String>, choices<Array>`\n\nCreates a CheckList(`checkbox`) from Inquirer\n```js\nCheckList('entry', 'what kind of entry do you want?', ['Array', 'Function'])\n```\n\n### Input \n\nParam: `name<String>, message<String>`\n\nCreates an Input from Inquirer\n```js\nInput('entry', 'what is your entry point?')\n```\n\n### InputValidate\n\nParam: `name<String>, message<String>, validate<Function>`\n\nCreates an Input from Inquirer\n```js\nconst validation = (value) => {\n    if(value.length > 4) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return 'Wow, that was short!'\n    }\n}\nInput('entry', 'what is your entry point?', validation)\n```\n\n### Confirm\n\nParam: `name<String>, message<String>`\n\nCreates an Input from Inquirer\n```js\nConfirm('contextConfirm', 'Is this your context?')\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"ev1stensberg","email":"evenstensberg@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-12-17T17:18:53.443Z","created":"2017-01-27T14:45:11.017Z","0.0.1":"2017-01-27T14:45:11.017Z","0.0.2":"2017-01-27T14:56:19.332Z","0.0.3":"2017-01-28T15:11:15.422Z","0.0.4":"2017-01-28T15:14:42.554Z","0.0.20":"2017-01-28T16:48:53.908Z","1.0.0":"2017-04-11T21:08:46.610Z","1.0.1":"2017-04-11T21:09:54.417Z","1.0.2":"2017-04-11T21:50:00.489Z","1.0.3":"2017-04-12T18:37:33.681Z","1.0.4":"2017-04-12T18:45:00.683Z","1.0.5":"2017-04-12T20:01:15.299Z","1.1.0":"2017-05-02T18:09:20.288Z","1.1.1":"2017-05-04T20:33:56.131Z","1.1.2":"2017-05-07T10:14:34.843Z","1.1.3":"2017-12-09T07:18:45.769Z","1.1.4":"2017-12-09T07:50:53.279Z","1.1.5":"2017-12-17T17:18:53.443Z"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-addons#readme","keywords":["scaffold","cli","webpack","ast"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-addons.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-addons/issues"},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"5a36a6fd-6096\"","_lastModified":"Sun, 17 Dec 2017 17:18:53 GMT"}
