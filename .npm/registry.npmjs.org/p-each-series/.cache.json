Prefer [`p-map`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-map) if you don't need side-effects, as it's concurrent.\n\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install --save p-each-series\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst pEachSeries = require('p-each-series');\n\nconst keywords = [\n\tgetTopKeyword() //=> Promise\n\t'rainbow',\n\t'pony'\n];\n\nconst iterator = el => saveToDiskPromise(el); //=> Promise\n\npEachSeries(keywords, iterator).then(result => {\n\tconsole.log(result);\n\t//=> ['unicorn', 'rainbow', 'pony']\n});\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### pEachSeries(input, iterator)\n\nReturns a `Promise` that is fulfilled when all promises in `input` and ones returned from `iterator` are fulfilled, or rejects if any of the promises reject. The fulfillment value is the original `input`.\n\n#### input\n\nType: `Iterable<Promise|any>`\n\nIterated over serially in the `iterator` function.\n\n#### iterator(element, index)\n\nType: `Function`\n\nReturn value is ignored unless it's `Promise`, then it's awaited before continuing with the next iteration.\n\n\n## Related\n\n- [p-map-series](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-map-series) - Map over promises serially\n- [p-pipe](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-pipe) - Compose promise-returning & async functions into a reusable pipeline\n- [p-reduce](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-reduce) - Reduce a list of values using promises into a promise for a value\n- [p-map](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-map) - Map over promises concurrently\n- [More…](https://github.com/sindresorhus/promise-fun)\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"sindresorhus","email":"sindresorhus@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-10-21T04:59:17.323Z","created":"2016-10-21T04:59:17.323Z","1.0.0":"2016-10-21T04:59:17.323Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-each-series#readme","keywords":["promise","foreach","for-each","for","each","collection","iterable","iterator","fulfilled","async","await","promises","serial","serially","series","bluebird"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-each-series.git"},"author":{"name":"Sindre Sorhus","email":"sindresorhus@gmail.com","url":"sindresorhus.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-each-series/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"readme.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"5809a0a5-1072\"","_lastModified":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 4:59:17 GMT"}
