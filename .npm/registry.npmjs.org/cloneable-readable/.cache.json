in https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl/issues/85\nand https://github.com/nodejs/readable-stream/issues/202. This is my take.\n\n**YOU MUST PIPE ALL CLONES TO START THE FLOW**\n\nYou can also attach `'data'` and `'readable'` events to them.\n\n## API\n\n### cloneable(stream)\n\nCreate a `Cloneable` stream.\nA Cloneable has a `clone()` method to create more clones.\nAll clones must be resumed/piped to start the flow.\n\n### cloneable.isCloneable(stream)\n\nCheck if `stream` needs to be wrapped in a `Cloneable` or not.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis project was kindly sponsored by [nearForm](http://nearform.com).\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"matteo.collina","email":"hello@matteocollina.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-03-14T20:01:51.514Z","created":"2016-04-26T09:06:46.503Z","0.1.0":"2016-04-26T09:06:46.503Z","0.2.0":"2016-09-01T07:13:39.121Z","0.3.0":"2016-09-08T04:53:20.206Z","0.4.0":"2016-09-18T07:54:30.280Z","0.5.0":"2016-09-21T06:43:18.455Z","1.0.0":"2016-10-25T12:48:39.281Z","1.1.0":"2018-03-07T10:56:06.159Z","1.1.1":"2018-03-07T11:46:42.793Z","1.1.2":"2018-03-14T20:01:50.758Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mcollina/cloneable-readable#readme","keywords":["readable","stream","clone"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/mcollina/cloneable-readable.git"},"author":{"name":"Matteo Collina","email":"hello@matteocollina.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mcollina/cloneable-readable/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"matteo.collina":true,"nicknaso":true,"seangenabe":true,"zhenguo.zhao":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"5aa97faf-3e54\"","_lastModified":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 20:01:51 GMT"}
